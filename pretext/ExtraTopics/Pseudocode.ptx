  <title>Pseudocode</title>

  <p><term>Pseudocode</term> is a mix of English and code (in our case, Python) where 
    programmers can plan out their programs.</p>

  <p>Writing <term>pseudocode</term> can help if you're wanting to plan before you write
    a program, take on a large or confusing programming task, or just as a way to
    document your code with comments to make it more readable for yourself and others.</p>

  <p>There isn't necessarily a right or wrong pseudocode (except wrong would be if you just wrote the program!).
    Your pseudocode and language will probably look different from this, but should be along the same lines.</p>

  <p>Take the following prompt for a problem:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Write a program that 
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can approach this problem first by writing the following pseudocode:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>

    </input>
  </program>

  <p>This won't be something you see often, but let's reverse engineer and see what
    existing Python code might look like in pseudocode.</p>

  <program language="python">
    <input>
character = input()
if character == "Yoda":
    print("No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.")
elif character == "Han Solo":
    print("Never tell me the odds!")
elif character == "Obi Wan Kenobi":
    print("Use the Force, Luke.")
else:
    print("Character not found!")
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>We could write the following pseudocode for this program:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
take user input for a Star Wars character
if the character is Yoda, print "No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try."
if the character is Han Solo, print "Never tell me the odds!"
if the character is Obi Wan Kenobi, "Use the Force, Luke."
in all other cases, print that the character wasn't found
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>As you may start to notice, Python is so close to the English language that pseudocode can often
    be quickly translated into code.</p>

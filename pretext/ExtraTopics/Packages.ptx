  <title>Packages and Dependencies</title>
  
  <p>One key tenant of computer science (or anything, for that matter) is that we don't want to reinvent
    the wheel if we don't have to. A lot of very smart people have made very useful code, so why not use it?</p>

  <p>The <url href="https://pypi.org" visual="Python Package Index (PyPI)"></url> is a website that maintains <term>packages</term>, or code that other people 
    have written for our use. You might also hear the term <term>dependencies</term>, which describes essentially the same thing: code
    that our code depends on.</p>

  <p>PyPI can be accessed with <c>pip</c>, which is the command that you will use when installing dependencies. Pip <em>should</em> come
    preinstalled with most Python installations on Mac and Windows.</p>

  <p>Some common packages include: <c>requests</c> (for sending HTTP requests), <c>boto3</c> (for dealing with AWS), <c>flask</c> (for making websites), and more.</p>

  <p>Some common packages for data science include <c>numpy</c>, <c>matplotlib</c>, <c>scipy</c>, <c>pandas</c> and more.</p>
  
  <p>But this is all sounding like a lot to keep track of, right? How can we ensure consistency between
    versions installed on different people's computers?</p>

  <p><term>requirements.txt</term> is a file we can specify for others to be able install the dependencies
    (which is needed to run our code), since others may not have our dependencies installed.</p>

  <p>The following code represents a <c>requirements.txt</c> file that specifies numpy as a dependency:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
numpy==1.26.2
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>Note that dependencies are not installed immediately. For someone to install the requirements which you specify,
    they would run the command: <c>pip install -r requirements.txt</c>.</p>

  <p>If you're unsure what version of a dependency you have installed, you can run the command: <c>pip show DEPENDENCY</c>, like <c>pip show numpy</c>.
    Somewhat ironically, there are also packages that can autogenerate a requirements.txt file for you.</p>

  <note>One additional tip worth mentioning is to always specify the bare minimum requirements your code needs to work.
    Dependencies normally have dependencies of their own, so we want to minimize the install time and space taken up
    when someone is installing your program's requirements.</note>

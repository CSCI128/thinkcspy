  <title>Data Science</title>

  <p>As the world moves more and more towards storing and analyzing large amounts of data,
    data science is a vital skill for you to know, whether you're a computer science major or not.</p>

  <p><term>The data science process</term> consists of four steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Obtain the data</li>
    <li>Clean the data</li>
    <li>Explore the data</li>
    <li>Predict unknowns</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The step that always takes the longest is cleaning the data! Data can come in all sorts of different
    formats now, with anomalies, with blanks, and so much more. Careful steps should be taken to clean the
    data and prepare it for the next steps.</p>

  <p><term>Obtaining the data</term>: There are many, many sites online now which have a plethora of
    data available for free (or paid) use. Your data will likely come in a .csv, .json, or SQL database format.</p>

  <p><term>Cleaning the data</term>: This can vary, but ultimately, you need to prepare your data
    and "wrangle" it into a format that is easily usable in the next steps. In this step, you may
    also fix certain things, change missing data, or fill in wrong data.</p>

  <p><term>Exploring the data</term>: We can do some analysis now! You may do some sort of statistical
    analysis or regression model, or you may simply graph values and look for relationships and trends visually.</p>

  <p><term>Predicting unknowns</term>: You may want to predict unknowns using machine learning, regression models,
    or algorithms such as K-means clustering.</p>

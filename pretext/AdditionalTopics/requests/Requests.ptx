  <title>Requests and Responses</title>

  <p>We've spoken about APIs, HTTP, and JSON. Now we can understand what's going
  on between the three and how data is transferred.</p>

  <p><term>Requests</term> are sent by applications that want data. Your web browser
  sent a request to a computer (we call these servers) owned by Runestone asking for this
  chapter of the book.</p>

  <p><term>Responses</term> are sent back for each request. Responses include data - whether
  that's the page you're viewing, or simply JSON.</p>

  <p>There are different types, or <term>methods</term> of requests. For our purposes
  here, you only need to know about <c>GET</c> and <c>POST</c>.</p>

  <p><c>GET</c> retrieves data. For instance, if you send a request to <c>GET google.com</c>, you will
  receive the HTML for the front page of Google. (This isn't a super useful visual. 
  This is why web browsers exist.) Or, maybe you have a website which has a list of
  classes available at Mines which you can send a GET request to. It would give something back like:</p>
  <pre>
{
  courses: [
    {
      "name": "Computer Science for STEM",
      "code": "CSCI128"
      "term": "Fall 2025"
    },
    {
      "name": "Physics I",
      "code": "PHGN100"
      "term": "Spring 2023"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
  </pre>

  <p>This is the useful case to us - we will request data and get it back in a <term>response</term>,
  usually in JSON.</p>

  <p>Responses also have codes attached to them; this is where the famous Error 404 "Not Found" comes from.
  This is HTTP status that is sent back if the requested resource can't be found. You might also commonly
  see codes like <c>200 OK</c>, <c>401 Unauthorized</c>, <c>403 Forbidden</c>, and <url href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" visual="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">more</url>.</p>

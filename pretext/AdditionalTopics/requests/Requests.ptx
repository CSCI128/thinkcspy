  <p><term>Requests</term> are sent by applications that want data. Your web browser
  sent a request to a computer (we call these servers) owned by Runestone asking for this
  chapter of the book.</p>

  <p><term>Responses</term> are sent back for each request. Responses include data - whether
  that's the page you're viewing, or simply JSON.</p>

  <title>Web Requests</title>

  <p>Web requests, or API requests, are a way that data transfers over the internet.
  We're (optionally) teaching them in this chapter in case you want to learn how to
  grab data from different sources online.</p>

  <p>An API, or <term>Application Programming Interface</term>, is a tool for developers 
  to safely interact with a program and its data, made by the developers of the original program. 
  It's an “outward-facing part” of a program. We don't want everyone to have our program's
  data, but maybe we want certain information to be accessible by anyone.</p>

  <p>
    There are a plethora of APIs you can use (going even beyond this list):

  </p>

  <p>APIs work over HTTP. <term>HTTP</term>, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the basis of the web.
  It defines <term>requests</term> and <term>responses</term> which we'll talk about shortly.
  You've probably heard of HTTP before; you're viewing this page over HTTP right now! (Actually
  HTTPS, which is secure HTTP.)</p>

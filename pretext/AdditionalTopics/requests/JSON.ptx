  <title>JSON</title>

  <p><term>JSON</term>, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a data format which
  is used all over the web. Requests and responses (which we'll talk about next)
  are sent with JSON.</p>

  <p>In a nutshell, you have <term>keys</term> and <term>values</term>, just like in dictionaries.
  Keys will be strings and values can be just about any type.</p>

  <p>There's also the notion of an <term>object</term>, similar to how we know them in Python.
  Objects "group" related data together. Objects are denoted with curly braces: <c>{}</c></p>

  <p>Consider the following example:</p>
  <pre>
{
  students: [
    {
      "name": "Student1",
      "major": "Environmental Engineering"
    },
    {
      "name": "Student2",
      "major": "Mechanical Engineering",
      "minor": "Computer Science"
    }
  ]
}
  </pre>

  <p>Note that data is not always the same structure. The first student
  did not have a <c>minor</c>, whereas the second student did. Normally
  data should be uniform, but it may not always be when you're making 
  different web requests.</p>

  <p>That's just a brief introduction to JSON. Thankfully, Python
  has an included <c>json</c> module since working with JSON is so common.
  Knowing JSON helps us greatly as web requests and responses rely on it.</p>

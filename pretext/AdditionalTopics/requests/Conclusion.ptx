  <title>Conclusion</title>

  <p>In this section, you learned about HTTP, JSON, requests and responses,
  request methods and response codes, and the Python requests module
  and how to make a web request to get data.</p>

  <p>One thing we glossed over is <term>authentication</term>. Often times,
  sites only want certain people to use their APIs. Or, they want to limit
  the amount of requests you can make (and make you pay for more). Thus,
  there needs to be a concept of whether or not a user is signed in (authentication) 
  and has the right permissions (authorization).</p>

  <p>API keys are just one form of authentication. Different (and more secure)
  authentication methods like OAuth2 exist and may be required depending on 
  what API you use.</p>

  <p>There are so many APIs out there - and once you grab the data, it's
  just like any other program. You could load your data into a matplotlib graph,
  or display it to a user in the terminal.</p>

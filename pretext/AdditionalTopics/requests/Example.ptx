  <title>Request Example</title>

    is an API that provides data about the weather. We will use it as our example here and
    retrieve the weather in Golden.
  </p>
  
  <p>Note that for this API, you will have to generate an <term>API key</term>, which
  is a random sequence of characters which is like a "password" for you to access the API.
  As such, you will have to make an account with OpenWeatherMap (it's free), generate an API
  key, and then use it in the code below.</p>

  <p>Copy this code into your code editor and modify the <c>API_KEY</c> variable. Run the code.</p>
  <pre>
import requests

API_KEY='TODO'

# Get location data for Golden
resp = requests.get(f'http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=Golden,CO,USA&amp;appid={API_KEY}')
resp = resp.json()

# Get the weather in Golden!
resp = requests.get(f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=39.7546349&amp;lon=-105.22058&amp;units=imperial&amp;appid={API_KEY}')
resp = resp.json()
print(resp)
  </pre>

  <p>In this code snippet, we can see the <c>requests</c> module (provided by Python by default)
  is fairly straightforward: it defines a function <c>.get()</c> to send a GET request to the specified URL.
  Then, we can simply call <c>.json()</c> on the response variable to get the response as JSON.</p>

  <p>This would look like:</p>
  <pre>

  </pre>

  <p>We can then use Python dictionary notation to get certain parts of the data out:</p>

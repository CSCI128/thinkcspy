  <title>Iteration Introduction</title>
  <p xml:id="more-about-iteration_index-1">Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
            similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
            people do poorly.</p>
  <p>Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called <term>iteration</term>.  Because
            iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
            easier. In this chapter we are going to look at two common forms of iteration: the <c>while</c> statement
            and the <c>for</c> statement.</p>

# How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition

This project began with the original How to Think Like a Computer Scientist text by Jeffrey Elkner, Peter Wentworth, Allen B. Downey, Chris  Meyers, and Dario Mitchell.  Since 2011 Brad Miller, David Ranum, Barbara Ericson, Mark Guzdial, and many others have built on the text making it interactive.

Programming is not a "spectator sport".  It is something you do,
something you participate in. It would make sense, then,
that the book you use to learn programming should allow you to be active.
That is our goal.

This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you learn
to program in Python.  You can read the text, watch videos,
and write and execute Python code.  In addition to simply executing code,
there is a unique feature called 'codelens' that allows you to control the
flow of execution in order to gain a better understanding of how the program
works.

Building with PreTeXt
---------------------

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. pip install pretext
3. To build run: pretext build web
4. pretext view

Note: The pretext sources are in the pretext folder, we will keep the _sources folder until we are 100% sure that the book has been converted correctly and as thoroughly as possible.
